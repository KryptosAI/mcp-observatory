Find problems in your MCP servers before your users do.

You update a server, a tool silently breaks, and your agent starts failing. MCP Observatory catches that. It connects to your servers, checks every capability, actually calls tools to make sure they work, and diffs runs to catch what changed.

[![Observatory MCP server](https://glama.ai/mcp/servers/KryptosAI/mcp-observatory/badges/card.svg)](https://glama.ai/mcp/servers/KryptosAI/mcp-observatory)

## Quick Start

Scan every MCP server in your Claude config:

```bash
npx @kryptosai/mcp-observatory
```

Go deeper — also invoke safe tools to verify they actually run:

```bash
npx @kryptosai/mcp-observatory scan deep
```

Test a specific server:

```bash
npx @kryptosai/mcp-observatory test npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-everything
```

Add it to Claude Code as an MCP server:

```bash
claude mcp add mcp-observatory -- npx -y @kryptosai/mcp-observatory serve
```

Or add it manually to your config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp-observatory": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@kryptosai/mcp-observatory", "serve"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `scan` | Auto-discover servers from config files and check them all (default) |
| `scan deep` | Scan and also invoke safe tools to verify they execute |
| `test <cmd>` | Test a specific server by command |
| `record <cmd>` | Record a server session to a cassette file for offline replay |
| `replay <cassette>` | Replay a cassette offline — no live server needed |
| `verify <cassette> <cmd>` | Verify a live server still matches a recorded cassette |
| `diff <base> <head>` | Compare two run artifacts for regressions and schema drift |
| `watch <config>` | Watch a server for changes, alert on regressions |
| `suggest` | Detect your stack and recommend MCP servers from the registry |
| `serve` | Start as an MCP server for AI agents |

Run with no arguments for an interactive menu:

## What It Does

**Check capabilities** — connects to a server and verifies tools, prompts, and resources respond correctly.

**Invoke tools** — goes beyond listing. Actually calls safe tools (no required params / readOnlyHint) and reports which ones work and which ones crash.

```bash
npx @kryptosai/mcp-observatory scan deep
```

**Detect schema drift** — diffs two runs and surfaces added/removed fields, type changes, and breaking parameter changes.

```bash
npx @kryptosai/mcp-observatory diff run-a.json run-b.json
```

**Recommend servers** — scans your project for languages, frameworks, databases, and cloud providers, then cross-references the [MCP registry](https://registry.modelcontextprotocol.io) to suggest servers you're missing.

```bash
npx @kryptosai/mcp-observatory suggest
```

Or ask your agent "what MCP servers should I add?" when running in MCP server mode.

**Record / replay / verify** — capture a live session, replay it offline in CI, and verify nothing changed. Like [VCR](https://github.com/vcr/vcr) for MCP.

```bash
# Record a session
npx @kryptosai/mcp-observatory record npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-everything

# Replay offline (no server needed)
npx @kryptosai/mcp-observatory replay .mcp-observatory/cassettes/latest.cassette.json

# Verify the live server still matches
npx @kryptosai/mcp-observatory verify cassette.json npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-everything
```

**Watch for regressions** — re-runs checks on an interval and alerts when something changes.

```bash
npx @kryptosai/mcp-observatory watch target.json
```

### Scan locations

When you run `scan`, it looks for MCP configs in:

- `~/.claude.json` (Claude Code)
- `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` (Claude Desktop, macOS)
- `%APPDATA%/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` (Claude Desktop, Windows)
- `.claude.json` and `.mcp.json` (current directory)

## MCP Server Mode

When running as an MCP server (`serve`), your AI agent gets the same capabilities as the CLI:

| Tool | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| `scan` | Discover and check all configured servers |
| `check_server` | Check a specific server by command |
| `record` | Record a server session to a cassette file |
| `replay` | Replay a cassette offline — no live server needed |
| `verify` | Verify a live server still matches a cassette |
| `watch` | Run checks and diff against the previous run |
| `diff_runs` | Compare two saved run artifacts |
| `get_last_run` | Return the most recent run for a target |
| `suggest_servers` | Scan your environment and recommend servers you're missing |

An AI tool that checks other AI tools. It's a tool testing tools that serve tools.*

## Compatibility

Works with any MCP server that uses standard transports:

| Transport | Examples | Adapter |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| **stdio** (most servers) | [filesystem](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem), [memory](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory), [context7](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@upstash/context7-mcp), [brave-search](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@modelcontextprotocol/server-brave-search), [sentry](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sentry/mcp-server), [notion](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@notionhq/notion-mcp-server), [stripe](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@stripe/mcp) | `local-process` |
| **HTTP/SSE** (remote) | [Cloudflare](https://developers.cloudflare.com/mcp/), [Exa](https://exa.ai), [Tavily](https://tavily.com) | `http` |
| **Docker** | All `@modelcontextprotocol/server-*` images | `local-process` via `docker run -i` |

Servers needing API keys work via `env` in the target config. Python servers work via `uvx`. See the [full compatibility matrix](./docs/compatibility.md) for tested servers and known issues.

### Target config files

For more control (env vars, metadata, custom timeout):

```json
{
  "targetId": "filesystem-server",
  "adapter": "local-process",
  "command": "npx",
  "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "."],
  "timeoutMs": 15000
}
```

```bash
npx @kryptosai/mcp-observatory run --target ./target.json
```

### HTTP / SSE targets

```json
{
  "targetId": "my-remote-server",
  "adapter": "http",
  "url": "http://localhost:3000/mcp",
  "authToken": "optional-bearer-token",
  "timeoutMs": 15000
}
```

## How It Compares

| Feature | Observatory | [mcp-recorder](https://github.com/punkpeye/mcp-recorder) | [MCPBench](https://github.com/QuantGeekDev/mcpbench) | [mcp-jest](https://github.com/nicobailon/mcp-jest) |
|---------|:-----------:|:----------:|:-------:|:-------:|
| Auto-discover servers | ✅ | — | — | — |
| Check capabilities | ✅ | — | ✅ | ✅ |
| Invoke tools | ✅ | — | — | ✅ |
| Schema drift detection | ✅ | — | — | — |
| Record / replay | ✅ | ✅ | — | — |
| Verify against cassette | ✅ | — | — | — |
| Response snapshot diffs | ✅ | — | — | — |
| Benchmarking / latency | — | — | ✅ | — |
| Jest integration | — | — | — | ✅ |
| MCP proxy mode | — | ✅ | — | — |
| Works as MCP server | ✅ | — | — | — |

Each tool has strengths. Observatory focuses on regression detection and CI-friendly workflows. mcp-recorder is great as a transparent proxy. MCPBench is the go-to for performance benchmarking. mcp-jest is ideal if you're already in a Jest workflow.

## Prior Art

The record/replay/verify pattern is inspired by:

- [VCR](https://github.com/vcr/vcr) (Ruby) — pioneered cassette-based HTTP record/replay
- [Polly.js](https://github.com/Netflix/pollyjs) (Netflix) — HTTP interaction recording for JavaScript
- [mcp-recorder](https://github.com/punkpeye/mcp-recorder) — MCP-specific traffic recording proxy
- [MCPBench](https://github.com/QuantGeekDev/mcpbench) — MCP server benchmarking
- [mcp-jest](https://github.com/nicobailon/mcp-jest) — Jest-style testing for MCP servers

## Limitations

- Servers requiring interactive OAuth (e.g., Google Drive) need pre-authentication before Observatory can connect
- Custom WebSocket transports (e.g., BrowserTools MCP) are not supported
- A few servers time out or close before init — see [known issues](./docs/known-issues.md) and [compatibility](./docs/compatibility.md)
