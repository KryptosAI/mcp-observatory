# MCP Security Platform: Scan Before You Trust, Enforce at Runtime

## The MCP Security Gap

The Model Context Protocol ecosystem has exploded. With over 47,000 repositories on GitHub and more than 65 security-focused tools available, MCP has become the primary interface between AI agents and the systems they control.

Yet a critical gap remains: **no single tool does both pre-install scanning AND runtime enforcement.**

- **Scanners** tell you a server looks risky — but they don't stop a single call.
- **Proxies** block traffic at runtime — but they don't tell you what to block until it's too late.
- **Gateways and firewalls** apply network-level rules — but they don't understand MCP semantics, tool arguments, or agent intent.

Enterprises deploying AI agents in production need both:

1. **Verify** MCP servers for vulnerabilities, exposed secrets, supply-chain risks, and dangerous capabilities *before* connecting them.
2. **Enforce** security policies on every tool call at runtime — allow, deny, warn, or redact — without modifying the agent or the server.

Today, the status quo is manual security review, ad-hoc nginx proxies, or nothing at all. That changes now.

## Our Two-Tool Platform

**mcp-observatory** scans before you trust. **mcp-seatbelt** enforces at runtime. Together, they form the only end-to-end MCP security platform.

**No competitor checks both the "Pre-install Scan" and "Runtime Enforcement" columns.** Tools either scan and report, or proxy and block — never both. Our platform is the only solution that covers the full lifecycle: discover risk before connection, block danger at call time.

## How They Integrate

### Direct Artifact Import

```bash
mcp-seatbelt import-observatory <artifact.json>
```

Observatory scan results convert directly into seatbelt policy rules. High and critical findings become `deny` rules. Medium findings become `warn` rules. The mapping is intelligent:

- Observatory tool findings → seatbelt `command` target rules
- Observatory path findings → seatbelt `file` target rules
- Observatory network/host findings → seatbelt `network` target rules
- Observatory env/credential findings → seatbelt `env` target rules

Seatbelt automatically discovers observatory artifacts in `.mcp-observatory/runs/` and `.mcp-observatory-metrics/` directories. Run `import-observatory` with no arguments and it finds the latest scan results automatically.

### Safety Index to Allowlist

Observatory's 0–100 safety index pre-populates seatbelt allowlists. Servers scoring above 80 can be automatically allowlisted. Servers below 40 get strict-deny rules. Everything in between gets a warning.

### Combined Telemetry & Metrics

Observatory telemetry shows **what the ecosystem looks like** — which servers are risky, where vulnerabilities cluster, what attack surfaces dominate. Seatbelt telemetry shows **what your agents are doing** — which tools get called, what gets blocked, what gets redacted. Together they give you:

- **Observatory metrics dashboard** (private): pre-install health scores across your MCP portfolio, CVE exposure trends, supply-chain risk distribution
- **Seatbelt dashboard** (live at `:9421`): real-time tool call stream, block/allow/warn ratios, per-client and per-server enforcement stats

### Unified CI/CD Pipeline

```
CI Pipeline:
  1. npx observatory scan      → SARIF report uploaded to code scanning
  2. npx observatory score     → safety index gates deployment
  3. npx seatbelt check        → critical risk detection fails the build
  4. npx seatbelt proxy        → runtime enforcement in staging/production
```

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# Step 1: Scan before you trust
npx @kryptosai/mcp-observatory scan
npx @kryptosai/mcp-observatory score npx -y my-mcp-server

# Step 2: Import findings into seatbelt
npx mcp-seatbelt init
npx mcp-seatbelt import-observatory .mcp-observatory/runs/latest.json

# Step 3: Enforce at runtime
npx mcp-seatbelt proxy --policy enforce
npx mcp-seatbelt dashboard
```

That's it. Three commands, one platform, full coverage.

## Enterprise Story

### Observatory Cloud — Hosted CI, Private Reports, Certification

Security teams don't want to run scanners on developer laptops. Observatory Cloud provides:

- Hosted scanning pipeline with private, per-organization reports
- Certification badges for verified-safe MCP servers — publish your safety score on npm, Smithery, and GitHub
- Compliance export for SOC 2, ISO 27001, and PCI DSS audit trails
- Team dashboards showing MCP risk posture across all projects

### Seatbelt Proxy — On-Premises Runtime Enforcement

Runtime enforcement stays where your data lives. Seatbelt runs on-premises, in your VPC, behind your firewall:

- No telemetry sent anywhere — all enforcement data stays local
- Policy-as-code in YAML, version-controlled alongside your infrastructure
- LDAP/OIDC integration for per-team, per-role policy assignment (roadmap)
- Prometheus metrics endpoint for integration with existing monitoring stacks (roadmap)

### Full Lifecycle MCP Security

```
DEVELOP          →    CI/CD          →    STAGING         →    PRODUCTION
─────────────         ──────────          ───────────         ────────────
observatory scan      observatory score   seatbelt audit       seatbelt enforce
  ↓                     ↓                   ↓                    ↓
Risk report           SARIF upload        Policy test          Live dashboard
Safety index          Build gate          Dry-run blocks       Active blocking
Attack simulation     PR comment          Import findings      Audit logging
```

**Scan in CI/CD. Enforce in production.** No gaps. No blind spots. No manual review bottleneck.
