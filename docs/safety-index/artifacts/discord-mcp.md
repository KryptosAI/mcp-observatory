- Command: `npx -y discord-mcp`
- Server: `discord-mcp 2.4.0`
- Platform: `darwin 25.5.0`
- Node: `v22.22.1`

## Executive Summary

**Health Score: 85/100 (B)**

| Dimension | Score | Weight |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Protocol Compliance | 100/100 | 30% |
| Schema Quality | 60/100 | 20% |
| Security | 100/100 | 20% |
| Reliability | 67/100 | 20% |
| Performance | 100/100 | 10% |

| Gate | Total | Pass | Fail | Partial | Unsupported | Flaky | Skipped |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| pass | 9 | 5 | 0 | 2 | 2 | 0 | 0 |

## At a Glance

- Safety verdict: **Needs review** — The server is usable, but caveated checks should be reviewed before agents depend on it.
- Top risks: runtime-profile: Detected 2 potential egress target(s) and 22 potential state mutation(s) with high confidence.; schema-quality: Found 1 quality finding(s) across 19 item(s): 0 warnings, 1 info.
- Regression/schema drift: Run `mcp-observatory diff <previous-run.json> <current-run.json>` to classify regressions and schema drift.
- Failing checks: none
- Partial or flaky checks: runtime-profile, schema-quality
- Skipped checks: none
- Unsupported checks: prompts, resources
- Suggested next step: Review the caveated checks next: runtime-profile, schema-quality.
- CI next step: `Add CI: npx @kryptosai/mcp-observatory setup-ci --all --command "npx -y <server-package>"`

## What Was Not Tested

- ℹ️ credential_access: Credential scanning was performed (see security findings)
- ℹ️ destructive_payloads: Destructive payloads were not attempted (safe-mode only)

## Runtime Profile
