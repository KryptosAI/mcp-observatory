## Executive Summary

**Health Score: 93/100 (A)**

| --- | --- | --- |
| Protocol Compliance | 100/100 | 30% |
| Schema Quality | 100/100 | 20% |
| Security | 100/100 | 20% |
| Reliability | 67/100 | 20% |

| Gate | Total | Pass | Fail | Partial | Unsupported | Flaky | Skipped |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| pass | 9 | 7 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 0 | 0 |

## At a Glance

- Safety verdict: **Needs review** — The server is usable, but caveated checks should be reviewed before agents depend on it.
- Top risks: No high-priority risks detected.
- Regression/schema drift: Run `mcp-observatory diff <previous-run.json> <current-run.json>` to classify regressions and schema drift.
- Failing checks: none
- Partial or flaky checks: none
- Skipped checks: none
- Unsupported checks: prompts, resources
- Suggested next step: Confirm that unsupported capabilities are intentional for this target: prompts, resources.
- CI next step: `Add CI: npx @kryptosai/mcp-observatory setup-ci --all --command "npx -y <server-package>"`

## What Was Not Tested

- ℹ️ credential_access: Credential scanning was performed (see security findings)
- ℹ️ destructive_payloads: Destructive payloads were not attempted (safe-mode only)

## Runtime Profile

### Egress Manifest

The following targets were identified as potentially reachable by this server (confidence: **medium**):

| Target | Protocol | Source | Confidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Whether to include supplementary information in the output. This includes UI5 API reference and documentation resources. When calling the tool multiple times for the same file or project, refrain from requesting additional context every time. | unknown | description_analysis | medium |
| run_ui5_linter | unknown | description_analysis | low |
| get_api_reference | unknown | description_analysis | low |
| URL of an OData V4 service, if applicable. This is entirely optional, but without it, the generated app UI will have no OData Model configured. Setting an URL will configure an OData V4 model in the application. Only works for OData V4 services, not for OData V2. The URL must be either a valid complete URL starting with http:// or https:// or a server-root-relative URL like '/odata/v4/serviceName' when the OData service is running on the same server. In this case, the prefix 'http://localhost:4004/' will be assumed and used by this tool for inquiries about the service. When the port is not 4004, a complete 'http://localhost:<port>...' URL must be provided. In the generated application, any 'http://localhost:<port>' prefix will be removed. HINT: when the project is a SAP CAP project and CAP/CDS tools are available, you **MUST** use them to search for OData services and entities and properties **BEFORE** calling this tool. This will help you find the correct service URL. | unknown | description_analysis | medium |
