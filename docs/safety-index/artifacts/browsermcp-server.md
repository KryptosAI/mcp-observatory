## At a Glance

- Safety verdict: **Needs review** — The server is usable, but caveated checks should be reviewed before agents depend on it.
- Top risks: No high-priority risks detected.
- Regression/schema drift: Run `mcp-observatory diff <previous-run.json> <current-run.json>` to classify regressions and schema drift.
- Failing checks: none
- Partial or flaky checks: none
- Skipped checks: none
- Unsupported checks: prompts
- Suggested next step: Confirm that unsupported capabilities are intentional for this target: prompts.
- CI next step: `Add CI: npx @kryptosai/mcp-observatory setup-ci --all --command "npx -y <server-package>"`

## Regressions and Recoveries

_Use the `diff` command against another run artifact to classify regressions and recoveries over time._
