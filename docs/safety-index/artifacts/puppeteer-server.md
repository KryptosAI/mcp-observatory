## Executive Summary

**Health Score: 82/100 (B)**

| Dimension | Score | Weight |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Protocol Compliance | 100/100 | 30% |
| Schema Quality | 60/100 | 20% |
| Security | 67/100 | 20% |
| Reliability | 83/100 | 20% |
| Performance | 100/100 | 10% |

| Gate | Total | Pass | Fail | Partial | Unsupported | Flaky | Skipped |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| fail | 9 | 5 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 0 | 0 |

## At a Glance

- Safety verdict: **Blocked** — One or more checks can break agent dependence and should be fixed before production use.
- Top risks: runtime-profile: Detected 3 potential egress target(s) and 2 potential state mutation(s) with high confidence.; schema-quality: Found 2 quality finding(s) across 9 item(s): 1 warnings, 1 info.; attack-sim: Safe attack simulation found 1 finding(s): 1 high, 0 medium, 0 low.
- Regression/schema drift: Run `mcp-observatory diff <previous-run.json> <current-run.json>` to classify regressions and schema drift.
- Failing checks: attack-sim
- Partial or flaky checks: runtime-profile, schema-quality
- Skipped checks: none
- Unsupported checks: prompts
- Suggested next step: Start with the failing checks: attack-sim.
- CI next step: `Add CI: npx @kryptosai/mcp-observatory setup-ci --all --command "npx -y <server-package>"`

## What Was Not Tested

- 🔒 filesystem_mutation: Filesystem write operations were not exercised
- ℹ️ credential_access: Credential scanning was performed (see security findings)
- ℹ️ destructive_payloads: Destructive payloads were not attempted (safe-mode only)

## Runtime Profile

### Egress Manifest

The following targets were identified as potentially reachable by this server (confidence: **high**):

| Target | Protocol | Source | Confidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Optional URL of the target tab to connect to. If not provided, connects to the first available tab. | unknown | description_analysis | medium |
| url | unknown | tool_schema | high |
| puppeteer_navigate | unknown | description_analysis | low |

### State Mutations

The following state-modifying operations were identified from tool schemas:

| Resource | Operation | Scope | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| filesystem | write | working_directory | description_analysis |
| filesystem | write | working_directory | description_analysis |

## Regressions and Recoveries

_Use the `diff` command against another run artifact to classify regressions and recoveries over time._
