## At a Glance

- Safety verdict: **Needs review** — The server is usable, but caveated checks should be reviewed before agents depend on it.
- Top risks: schema-quality: Found 2 quality finding(s) across 15 item(s): 0 warnings, 2 info.
- Regression/schema drift: Run `mcp-observatory diff <previous-run.json> <current-run.json>` to classify regressions and schema drift.
- Failing checks: none
- Partial or flaky checks: schema-quality
- Skipped checks: none
- Unsupported checks: prompts, resources
- Suggested next step: Review the caveated checks next: schema-quality.
- CI next step: `Add CI: npx @kryptosai/mcp-observatory setup-ci --all --command "npx -y <server-package>"`

## What Was Not Tested

- 🔒 network_egress: No outbound network calls were attempted during scan
- 🔒 filesystem_mutation: Filesystem write operations were not exercised
- ℹ️ credential_access: Credential scanning was performed (see security findings)
- ℹ️ destructive_payloads: Destructive payloads were not attempted (safe-mode only)
